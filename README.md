A Framework library for controlling the SAP GUI Desktop and focused on testing business processes. The library uses the native SAP GUI scripting engine for interaction with the desktop client application. 

Other dependances include the below packages as this library would not be possible without the hard work of so many others.

### What makes this library different from other SAP GUI libraries? 
The main difference is the focus on testing end to end business processes in and around SAP GUI. While other libraries are similar in many aspects there are many additional comfort of life functions included that aren't in other libraries. 

This package is available also on PyPi and available for install via pip. For the latest updates please use the git install documented in the [Getting Started](/docs/tutorials/getting_started.md) section.
